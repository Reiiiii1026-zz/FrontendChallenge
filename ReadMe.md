I'm now learning web developing and this page is my first challenge on Frontend Mentor. You can find the detail of challenge here ->https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5 I also save the challenge design JPG in design folder. Hence I haven't finish mobile web developing course yet, I have only done the desktop version for practice.
